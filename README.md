## Synopsis

Using **Unity**, we incorporated elements such as Mars' gravity, density, and atmosphere conditions, that enabled us to test our project, allowing us to prototype it virtually. We concluded that all the elements of our project, facilitate the astronaut to travel longer distances in a shorter time, going through a more difficult terrain. This helps the astronaut to enjoy a cozy Martian exploration.

## Installation

Just download the Unity Project, and run it using Unity 5.3.4 or later.
